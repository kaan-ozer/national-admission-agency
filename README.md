Our team had to build a whole .NET MVC web application. Our assignment was to create a web app for the National Admission Agency (NAA) to allow future students to apply to different universities. 
The app had to provide an API to the universities to allow them to review the applications and admit/deny the applicants. The app covers features like authentication and authorization with an extendable role system.
